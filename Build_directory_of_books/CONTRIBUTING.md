##Build a directory of books

Building a book directory is one of the classic Node.js project ideas. The command GET retrieves all the books, POST adds a new book, PUT updates an old book, and DELETE removes a book. This is an essential project for learning how the REST API functionality of Node.js works. It’s one of the first projects you should get started with — especially if you’ve never worked with REST API before.
